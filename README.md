## About WIP

Besides being a hopefully useful GitHub application, the WIP app is also meant as a reference implementation. I try to keep the complexity low and the code easy to follow. If you are thinking of creating your own GitHub app, the WIP might be a good starting point for you.

Besides the code, I also made our [policies](https://github.com/wip/policies) good templates for your app.

All revenue from the "pro" plan will be donated to [Rails Girls Summer of Code](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/). I only added the paid plan to make the WIP a real-life GitHub App example. If you cannot pay but depend on the pro features, please let me know, I’m sure we can find a way.

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to create an issue.
